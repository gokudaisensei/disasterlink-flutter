- Separate component files for maintainability

### **State Management**
- `BluetoothStore` with reactive state updates
- Mock data for demonstration purposes
- Connection status tracking
- Device scanning simulation
- Error handling with user feedback

## üéØ Mock Data

The screen includes realistic mock data for demonstration:
- **Emergency Response Unit** (Laptop, 85% signal)
- **Rescue Team Alpha** (Phone, 72% signal)  
- **Medical Unit-01** (Tablet, 68% signal)
- **Base Station** (Laptop, 95% signal)
- **Field Commander** (Phone, 60% signal)

## üì± How to Use

1. **Navigate**: Tap the "Bluetooth Mesh" card on the home screen
2. **Enable**: Toggle Bluetooth on using the switch
3. **Scan**: Use the floating action button or pull-to-refresh to scan for devices
4. **Connect**: Tap "Connect" on any available device
5. **Monitor**: View connection statistics and signal strength
6. **Disconnect**: Tap "Disconnect" to remove devices from the mesh

## üé® Design Consistency

The Bluetooth screen perfectly matches your existing app design:
- Same color scheme (Blue #1565C0)
- Consistent card styling with rounded corners
- Matching typography and spacing
- Similar shadow and elevation effects
- Emergency/disaster response theming
- Modern Material Design 3 principles

This creates a seamless and professional user experience that feels like a natural extension of your DisasterLink app!
